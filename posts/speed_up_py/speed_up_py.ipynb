        "Ever felt the need to turbo boost your Python code? Tired of the seemingly endless wait for your iterations or simulations to complete? Allow me to present the [`rustimport`](https://github.com/mityax/rustimport) library. In its most basic form, `rustimport` empowers you to call highly optimized Rust functions from within your code. This way, you can delegate the heavy-duty tasks to Rust, instead of relying on Python, a language known for its versatility but also for its slower speed. With `rustimport`, you can enjoy the best of both worlds - the simplicity of Python and the performance of Rust.\n",

It then iterates over the primes list, for each prime calculating the sum of primes from the current prime to the end of the list. If the sum exceeds the target, it breaks the inner loop. If the sum is prime and the length of the sequence is greater than `max_length`, it updates `max_length` and `max_prime`. The function finally returns `max_prime` and `max_length`.\n",
