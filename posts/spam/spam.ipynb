        "Welcome to this week's Tidy Tuesday! Today, we're delving into the intriguing yet bothersome realm of email spams. You know, those unsolicited messages that flood our inboxes? They go by many names like junk email or spam mail, and they're sent in bulk. The term \"spam\" got its name from a Monty Python sketch where the word \"Spam\" was everywhere, just like these emails. Starting from the early 1990s, these spam messages have been on a steady rise, making up around 90% of all email traffic by 2014.\n",
