        "Once I shared my first article about [\"Getting Started with Polars\"](https://adamcseresznye.github.io/blog/posts/polars/Polars_revised.html) I started thinking about something exciting: comparing the speed of Polars and Pandas. This curiosity was sparked by all the buzz around the brand-new [Pandas 2.0 release](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html), promising lightning-fast performance. Pandas 2.0 was announced to come packed with cool features, including the addition of Apache Arrow (pyarrow) as its backing memory format. The big perk of Apache Arrow is that it makes operations speedier and more memory-friendly. Naturally, this got me wondering: how does Pandas 2.0 measure up against Polars? Let's dive in and find out!\n",

        "Throughout our exploration, Polars has consistently outperformed Pandas. We intentionally focused on tasks that frequently arise in data analysis, encompassing file reading, column selection, filtering, and more. However, where Polars truly shines is in aggregation, capitalizing on its multiprocessing prowess. Take a glance at @fig-fig14, and you'll notice that reading files is the most time-consuming step for Polars. To address this (and reduce memory usage at the same time), we have the nifty `scan_csv` function that enables Polars to operate in a lazy mode, optimizing the entire data pipeline. It's clear that Polars packs a punch in the realm of data processing!\n",

If you're open to investing time in understanding its API (which isn't drastically different from Pandas), I'm confident your projects will gain a significant speed boost.
