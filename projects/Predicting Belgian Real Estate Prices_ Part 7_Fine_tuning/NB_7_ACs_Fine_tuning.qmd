In Part 6, we established a robust cross-validation strategy to consistently assess our model's performance across multiple data folds. We also identified and managed potential outliers in our dataset. Additionally, we explored diverse feature engineering methods, creating and evaluating informative features to enhance our model's predictive capabilities. 

In this final segment, we'll optimize our hyperparameters using Optuna and end by evaluating the final model's performance based on the test portion. Let's dive in!

Up to this point, we've successfully obtained all the house advertisements from ImmoWeb. We've conducted data description, preselected features, established an effective data pre-processing pipeline, and identified the most suitable machine learning algorithm for this task. Additionally, we've engaged in feature engineering and carried out further feature selection to streamline our machine learning model. The final pha, that's yet to be done,se involves fine-tuning the hyperparameters of our machine learning model, enhancing predictive accuracy while mitigating overfittin


# Prepare dataframe before modelling

Let's get our data ready for modeling by applying the `prepare_data_for_modelling` function as detailed in Part 6. A quick recap: this function carries out the subsequent actions to prepare a DataFrame for machine learning:  

1. It randomly shuffles the DataFrame's rows.
2. The 'price' column is transformed into the base 10 logarithm.
3. Categorical variable missing values are replaced with 'missing value.'
4. It divides the data into features (X) and the target (y).
5. Using `LocalOutlierFactor`, it identifies and removes outlier values.

```{python}
df = pd.read_parquet(
    utils.Configuration.INTERIM_DATA_PATH.joinpath(
        "2023-10-01_Processed_dataset_for_NB_use.parquet.gzip"
    )
)

X, y = pre_process.prepare_data_for_modelling(df)
```

We'll divide the data into training and testing sets. The training portion will be dedicated to hyperparameter tuning. It's worth noting that, to guard against overfitting during hyperparameter tuning, we'll implement cross-validation. This involves splitting the training set into subgroups for training and validation. The validation portion helps prevent overfitting, and the training continues until we achieve the desired performance. The test set will come into play later for evaluating our final model.

```{python}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=utils.Configuration.seed,
)

print(f"Shape of X_train: {X_train.shape}, Shape of X_test: {X_test.shape}")
```

We'll also create a handy helper function called `dumper`. This function enables us to save the best parameters discovered during tuning as a `.pickle` file, allowing us to load and utilize these parameters from the saved file at a later time.

```{python}
def dumper(file: Any, name: str) -> None:
    """
    Pickle and save an object to a file.

    This function takes an object and a name, then uses the Pickle library to serialize
    and save the object to a file with the given name. The file is saved in binary mode ('wb').

    Args:
        file (Any): The object to be pickled and saved.
        name (str): The name of the file, including the file extension, where the object will be saved.

    Returns:
        None: This function does not return a value.

    Example:
        To save an object to a file:
        >>> my_data = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> dumper(my_data, "my_data.pickle")

    Note:
        The file is saved in binary mode ('wb') to ensure compatibility and proper
        handling of binary data.
    """
    pickle.dump(file, open(f"{name}.pickle", "wb"))
```

## Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna

To identify the most optimal settings, we'll leverage the Optuna library. The key hyperparameters under consideration are iterations, depth, learning_rate, random_strength, bagging_temperature, and others.

```{python}
def objective(trial: optuna.Trial) -> float:
    """
    Optuna objective function for tuning CatBoost hyperparameters.

    This function takes an Optuna trial and explores hyperparameters for a CatBoost
    model to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) using K-Fold cross-validation.

    Parameters:
    - trial (optuna.Trial): Optuna trial object for hyperparameter optimization.

    Returns:
    - float: Mean RMSE across K-Fold cross-validation iterations.

    Example use case:
    # Create an Optuna study and optimize hyperparameters
    study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")
    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)

    # Get the best hyperparameters
    best_params = study.best_params
    """
    catboost_params = {
        "iterations": trial.suggest_int("iterations", 10, 1000),
        "depth": trial.suggest_int("depth", 1, 8),
        "learning_rate": trial.suggest_float("learning_rate", 0.01, 1),
        "random_strength": trial.suggest_float("random_strength", 1e-9, 10),
        "bagging_temperature": trial.suggest_float("bagging_temperature", 0, 1),
        "l2_leaf_reg": trial.suggest_int("l2_leaf_reg", 2, 30),
        "border_count": trial.suggest_int("border_count", 1, 255),
        "thread_count": os.cpu_count(),
    }

    results = []
    optuna.logging.set_verbosity(optuna.logging.WARNING)

    # Extract feature names and data types
    # features = X.columns[~X.columns.str.contains("price")]
    # numerical_features = X.select_dtypes("number").columns.to_list()
    categorical_features = X.select_dtypes("object").columns.to_list()

    # Create a K-Fold cross-validator
    CV = model_selection.RepeatedKFold(
        n_splits=10, n_repeats=1, random_state=utils.Configuration.seed
    )

    for train_fold_index, val_fold_index in CV.split(X):
        X_train_fold, X_val_fold = X.loc[train_fold_index], X.loc[val_fold_index]
        y_train_fold, y_val_fold = y.loc[train_fold_index], y.loc[val_fold_index]

        # Create CatBoost datasets
        catboost_train = catboost.Pool(
            X_train_fold,
            y_train_fold,
            cat_features=categorical_features,
        )
        catboost_valid = catboost.Pool(
            X_val_fold,
            y_val_fold,
            cat_features=categorical_features,
        )

        # Initialize and train the CatBoost model
        model = catboost.CatBoostRegressor(**catboost_params)
        model.fit(
            catboost_train,
            eval_set=[catboost_valid],
            early_stopping_rounds=utils.Configuration.early_stopping_round,
            verbose=utils.Configuration.verbose,
            use_best_model=True,
        )

        # Calculate OOF validation predictions
        valid_pred = model.predict(X_val_fold)

        RMSE_score = metrics.mean_squared_error(y_val_fold, valid_pred, squared=False)

        del (
            X_train_fold,
            y_train_fold,
            X_val_fold,
            y_val_fold,
            catboost_train,
            catboost_valid,
            model,
            valid_pred,
        )
        gc.collect()

        results.append(RMSE_score)
    return np.mean(results)
```

::: {.callout-note}
Similar to Part 6, the hyperparameter optimization step was pre-computed due to the significant computational time needed. The results were saved rather than executed during notebook rendering to save time. However, note that the outcomes should remain unchanged.
:::

```{python}
%%script echo skipping

study = optuna.create_study(direction="minimize")
study.optimize(train_model.Optuna_Objective(X_train, y_train), n_trials=100, show_progress_bar=True)

dumper(study.best_params, "CatBoost_params")
dumper(study.best_value, "CatBoost_value")
```

As shown below, Optuna found the best Out-Of-Fold (OOF) score using the selected parameters, which is 0.1060. Recall that in Part 6, our best OOF score was 0.1070, so this represents a modest improvement, albeit a slight one.

```{python}
catboost_params_optuna = pd.read_pickle("CatBoost_params.pickle")

print(
    f'The best OOF RMSE score of the hyperparameter tuning is {pd.read_pickle("CatBoost_value.pickle"):.4f}.'
)
print(f"The corresponding values: {catboost_params_optuna}")
```

# Retrain using the best parameters and predict

After obtaining the most optimal parameters, we can proceed to retrain our model using the entire dataset, excluding the test portion, of course. For this we can use the `train_catboost` as seen below.

```{python}
def train_catboost(
    X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series, catboost_params: dict
) -> catboost.CatBoostRegressor:
    """
    Train a CatBoostRegressor model using the provided data and parameters.

    Parameters:
        X (pd.DataFrame): The feature dataset.
        y (pd.Series): The target variable.
        catboost_params (dict): CatBoost hyperparameters.

    Returns:
        CatBoostRegressor: The trained CatBoost model.

    This function takes the feature dataset `X`, the target variable `y`, and a dictionary of CatBoost
    hyperparameters. It automatically detects categorical features in the dataset and trains a CatBoostRegressor
    model with the specified parameters.

    Example:
        X, y = load_data()
        catboost_params = {
            'iterations': 1000,
            'learning_rate': 0.1,
            'depth': 6,
            # ... other hyperparameters ...
        }
        model = train_catboost(X, y, catboost_params)
    """
    categorical_features = X.select_dtypes("object").columns.to_list()

    catboost_train = catboost.Pool(
        X,
        y,
        cat_features=categorical_features,
    )

    model = catboost.CatBoostRegressor(**catboost_params)
    model.fit(
        catboost_train,
        verbose=utils.Configuration.verbose,
    )

    return model
```

```{python}
model = train_model.train_catboost(X_train, y_train, catboost_params_optuna)
```

Excellent! We've made good progress. Now, it's time for the final evaluation of our dataset using the test set. We can use the `predict_catboost` function for this.

```{python}
def predict_catboost(
    model: catboost.CatBoostRegressor,
    X: pd.DataFrame,
    thread_count: int = -1,
    verbose: int = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Make predictions using a CatBoost model on the provided dataset.

    Parameters:
        model (catboost.CatBoostRegressor): The trained CatBoost model.
        X (pd.DataFrame): The dataset for which predictions are to be made.
        thread_count (int, optional): The number of threads for prediction. Default is -1 (auto).
        verbose (int, optional): Verbosity level. Default is None.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Predicted values.

    This function takes a trained CatBoost model, a dataset `X`, and optional parameters for
    specifying the number of threads (`thread_count`) and verbosity (`verbose`) during prediction.
    It returns an array of predicted values.

    Example:
        model = load_catboost_model()
        X_new = load_new_data()
        predictions = predict_catboost(model, X_new, thread_count=4, verbose=2)
    """
    prediction = model.predict(data=X, thread_count=thread_count, verbose=verbose)
    return prediction
```

To assess the predictions, we'll obtain both RMSE and R2 values.

```{python}
prediction = predict_model.predict_catboost(model=model, X=X_test)
```

```{python}
def score_prediction(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculate regression evaluation metrics based on
    true and predicted values.

    Parameters:
        y_true (array-like): True target values.
        y_pred (array-like): Predicted values.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
        and R-squared (R2).

    This function calculates RMSE and R2 to evaluate the goodness
    of fit between the true target values and predicted values.

    Example:
        y_true = [3, 5, 7, 9]
        y_pred = [2.8, 5.2, 7.1, 9.3]
        rmse, r2 = score_prediction(y_true, y_pred)
    """
    RMSE = np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_true, np.log10(y_pred)))
    R2 = metrics.r2_score(y_true, y_pred)

    return RMSE, R2
```

Superb! As you can see, the test set has an RMSE of 0.1101 and an R2 of 0.877. It's worth noting that the test set's RMSE is slightly higher than that of the training set, which is expected and suggests overfitting. Despite our efforts to prevent overfitting, it can be challenging to eliminate entirely. Nevertheless, it appears that we've done well.

```{python}
predict_model.score_prediction(y_pred=prediction, y_true=y_test)
```

Let's put the original values and prediction in a DataFrame so that we can evaluate them visually as well.

```{python}
results = (
    pd.concat(
        [y_test.reset_index(drop=True), pd.Series(prediction)], axis="columns"
    ).rename(columns={"price": "original_values", 0: "predicted_values"})
    # .apply(lambda x: 10**x)
    .assign(residuals=lambda df: df.original_values - df.predicted_values)
)
results
```

As depicted below, our model demonstrates the ability to generalize effectively for unseen data, showcasing high R2 values and low RMSE. Additionally, examining the residuals reveals an even distribution, symbolizing robust model performance.

```{python}
