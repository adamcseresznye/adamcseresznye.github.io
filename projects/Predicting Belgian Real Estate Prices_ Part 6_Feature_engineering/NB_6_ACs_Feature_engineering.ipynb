However, as we conclude this article, we've found that we can streamline our feature set even further by removing `kitchen_type` and `toilets` resulting in improved performance, thanks to the addition of new features. While there's potential for further optimizations, such as dimensional reduction, we are currently happy with our progress. In the next, and final, part, we will focus on fine-tuning our model for optimal predictive performance. See you there!\n"
